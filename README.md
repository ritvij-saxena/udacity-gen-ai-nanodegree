# Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree Projects

This repository contains assignments and projects completed as part of the [Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai-nanodegree--nd345). The projects focus on applying generative AI techniques, including lightweight fine-tuning and building custom AI solutions.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Lightweight Fine-Tuning**
   - **Description**: This project focuses on the fine-tuning of pre-trained models with a small dataset to adapt the model for a specific task. It demonstrates how to leverage transfer learning to optimize performance while minimizing computational resources and time.
   - **Technologies Used**: 
     - Python
     - PyTorch/TensorFlow
     - Hugging Face Transformers
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Transfer learning
     - Model fine-tuning
     - Efficient training techniques
   - **Status**: Complete

### 2. **Custom Chatbot**
   - **Description**: This project involves creating a custom chatbot tailored to specific needs or use cases. It involves training a conversational model, integrating it with an interface, and customizing responses for a more personalized experience.
   - **Technologies Used**:
     - Python
     - NLP (Natural Language Processing)
     - OpenAI GPT models
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Conversational AI
     - Model customization
     - User interaction design
   - **Folder**: `custom_chatbot`
   - **Status**: In Progress
