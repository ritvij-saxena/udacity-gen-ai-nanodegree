# HomeMatch - Personalized Real Estate Listings

Welcome to **HomeMatch**, a cutting-edge application developed by **Future Homes Realty**. HomeMatch transforms the traditional real estate search into a personalized experience, tailoring property listings to match individual buyer preferences using the latest advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases.

## Project Overview

### The Vision

In today's real estate market, personalization is key to enhancing customer satisfaction. HomeMatch redefines how clients interact with real estate listings by creating a tailored experience for each buyer, making the property search process more engaging and relevant to their unique needs.

### Key Features

1. **Understanding Buyer Preferences**
   - Buyers can input their specific requirements, including location, property type, budget, amenities, and lifestyle preferences.
   - HomeMatch employs LLMs to interpret these inputs in natural language, capturing nuanced preferences beyond basic filters.

2. **Integrating with a Vector Database**
   - HomeMatch connects to a vector database where all property listings are stored.
   - By leveraging vector embeddings, it matches properties to buyer preferences based on factors such as neighborhood vibes, architectural styles, and proximity to specific amenities.

3. **Personalized Listing Description Generation**
   - For each matched property, HomeMatch generates a personalized description that emphasizes aspects most relevant to the buyerâ€™s preferences.
   - The descriptions are tailored without altering the factual details of the property.

4. **Listing Presentation**
   - The application outputs personalized property listings as detailed text descriptions, enhancing the buyer's engagement and satisfaction.
